# Comparison uses ImageMagick `compare -metric AE -fuzz $GOLDEN_FUZZ` with a
# pixel budget: the borealis focus-highlight pulse is wall-clock driven, so
# two identical runs already differ by ~9k px of 1280x720 (llvmpipe).
# LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 keeps local and CI rendering on the same
# rasterizer (Mesa llvmpipe); remaining AA drift is absorbed by the budget.
